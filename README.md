<h2> Aboutüçà</h2>
Fruit Ninja is a popular game that was first released in 2010. Developed by Halfbrick Studios, the game quickly gained 
popularity and became a favorite among players of all ages. The objective of the game is simple: slice as many fruits as possible while avoiding bombs.


The gameplay of Fruit Ninja is straightforward and easy to understand. Players are presented with a screen full of fruits, such as watermelons, 
oranges, lemons, and apples, continuously being thrown up into the air. Using their finger or a virtual blade, players slice through the fruits, 
earning points for each successful slice.

Timing and accuracy are key in Fruit Ninja. Players must carefully time their slices to ensure they hit the fruits and not the bombs. Slicing a bomb 
results in an immediate game over, so players must be cautious and focused. As the game progresses, the speed and number of fruits increase, making it 
more challenging to slice them all.

The game's vibrant and colorful graphics, coupled with its intuitive controls, make Fruit Ninja a visually appealing and enjoyable experience. With its 
addictive gameplay and simple yet challenging mechanics, it's no wonder that Fruit Ninja has become a staple among mobile gamers worldwide.
